                <p>When I joined the <a href="https://designsystems.quickbooks.com/" title="QuickBooks Design System">QuickBooks Design System</a> team last year, I started collecting design system resources for my personal reference. ðŸ““ I've gone back and browsed my collection of sites, articles and tools countless times since then. I decided to organize and catalog these resources into a site so it can be of help to others in the design community. ðŸ™Œ</p>

                <p>Design Systems Repo was designed in the browser using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and coded in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. ðŸ’» I'm using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> ðŸŒ¡ to compile the site's markdown content into a static site. This is the first time I've used Jekyll, so I'm still learning it and working through a few issues. The site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> ðŸ˜¸ and the CDN and SSL is provided by <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" title="Cloudflare">Cloudflare</a>. ðŸŒŽ</p>

                <p>The beautiful type I'm using on the site is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/plex/">Plex</a> ðŸ”¤ from IBM. The illustrations were from the <a href="http://www.streamlineicons.com/ux/">Streamline UX set</a> ðŸŒŸ made by my friend, <a href="https://twitter.com/webalys">Vincent Le Moign</a> ðŸŽ¨ who creates amazing icons and illustrations for designers.</p>

                <p>When I joined the <a href="https://designsystems.quickbooks.com/" title="QuickBooks Design System">QuickBooks Design System</a> team last year, I started collecting design system resources for my personal reference. I decided to organize it all and put it on a site so it can be of help to the design community. ðŸ™Œ</p>
